# Dongting-Lake-Data-2001-2020
High spatiotemporal resolution images from 2001 to 2020 in Dongting Lake

Monitoring the spatiotemporal change of Dongting Lake wetland by integrating Landsat and MODIS images, from 2001 to 2020

The reconstructed images and wetland maps are openly available in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mSamADjGeLEApZljaqq_rg?pwd=cumt (For Chinese scholars) and https://mega.nz/folder/dxVAFLJL#hQSg4s1JIbO12__t9E9r2w (more international-friendly).

In the future, we will use deep learning spatiotemporal fusion method to reconstruct more reliable images of Dongting Lake
