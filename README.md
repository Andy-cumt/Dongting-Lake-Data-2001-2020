Dizhou Guo, Wenzhong Shi, Fangrui Qian, Shujuan Wang, Cai Cai, Monitoring the spatiotemporal change of Dongting Lake wetland by integrating Landsat and MODIS images, from 2001 to 2020, Ecological Informatics, Volume 72, 2022, 101848, ISSN 1574-9541, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101848.

The reconstructed images and wetland maps are openly available in https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mSamADjGeLEApZljaqq_rg?pwd=cumt (For Chinese scholars) and https://mega.nz/folder/dxVAFLJL#hQSg4s1JIbO12__t9E9r2w (more international-friendly).

In the future, we will use deep learning spatiotemporal fusion method to reconstruct more reliable images of Dongting Lake
